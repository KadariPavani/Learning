Node Js --> Multipurpose programming language 
Used for , 
DOM manipulation
API, Game development, ML and Robotics

JS only works inside the browser, we can't run outside of the browser
Do only for HTML and CSS and DOM manipulation

2009 -ryan dahl created Node JS -JS Runtime (Its a piece of S/w), so we can run in outside
As like  node js --> Deno, Bun (latest)
 
So we can use outside 

----------------------------------------

Inside the browser also we have engine that is V8 engine is used to run JavaScript, nodejs also use the same engine, so there are much more powers like 
1. Access OS 
2. Access Files
3. Access Network

npmjs --> main js library


----------------------------------------------

Download steps

 // We can't do DOM manipulation until and unless we have html file.
