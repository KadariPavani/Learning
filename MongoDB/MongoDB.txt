MONGODB
• It is a Database Management System.
• Our job is to create Applications (web/mobile).  

• Frontend does not directly communicate with the database; there is something in between that helps → APIs.  
• These APIs communicate with the database to retrieve data. The database returns the data to the API (formatted, structured, and useful data), which is then sent to the frontend.  

Process:  
Frontend requests data from API → API processes the request and queries the database → Database responds to the API → API sends the response to the frontend.  

DATABASE:  
A database is a place where data is stored and managed. Whenever the application needs data, it requests the database, which then delivers the required data.  

Examples: emails, products, etc.  
The data can be anything (notepad files, Excel sheets, etc.).  

Popular database companies:  
• Microsoft SQL Server  
• Oracle SQL Server  

Open-source databases (also available with free domain and hosting servers):  
• MySQL  
• PostgreSQL  

Databases can be installed on a PC or used in paid cloud-based versions for real-time applications.  

Every database system works differently, but the main goal is to store and manage data efficiently.  

Examples:  
• Notepad and Excel store data, but databases offer much more functionality.  
• Databases can be connected in real-time using APIs.  

Some databases store data in different formats:  
• Table-based  
• Object-based  
• Graph-based  
• Key-value format  

Storing data in a database is not enough; we also need to interact with it (store, update, delete, fetch, view).  
To do this, we use commands:  
• SQL commands (for Microsoft SQL, Oracle, MySQL) through a terminal  
• API-based connections (Java, JavaScript, Python)  
• User-friendly software interfaces for layman users  

Databases can be installed locally on a PC or accessed via cloud-based services.  

MONGODB  
• Stores data in a document-based format.  

Example:  
{
    "name": "My Name",
    "age": 1
}

Key terms:  
• Database Management System → A complete software that holds multiple databases.  
• Database → A place where similar types of data are stored, usually categorized based on projects.  
• SQL-based databases store data in tables (e.g., users, admins, products).
